        The key point falls on the design. Even though you are a small, bootstrapped startup, there better be a web 
        designer to help you with your website design. Of course, it will be best if the web designers can collaborate with 
        developers from the very beginning with a good online design collaboration tool.

        It’s not easy to design a good website that is both beautiful and functional. Experienced UX consultants could 
        help you analyze your target user's behavior, create and implement effective UI – with the ultimate goal to take 
        your product’s user experience to the next level. This is what makes you achieve solid business results.
